# Group-Chatting-Application
This is a Group Chatting Application using Java that allows users to communicate with each other in real-time within a group chat environment. The application features a graphical user interface (GUI) where users can send messages and manage their chat preferences.

The application utilizes Java's networking capabilities to establish connections between users and facilitate message exchange. It incorporates multi-threading to handle concurrent connections and ensure smooth communication among multiple users simultaneously.

The application provides a seamless and interactive platform for group communication, making it ideal for teams, communities, or social groups to collaborate and engage in discussions. It showcases my proficiency in Java programming, networking, and GUI development for creating robust and user-friendly applications.
